Logic of marketplace categories:

*A vendor can make a product category with attributes*

Now, what is an attibute?

An attribute is a "type" or quality for example...

If a category is "Clothing", attributes will be...
-> size
-> color
-> gender
etc...

To create a category, the user must send a list of attributes.

So to create a category, the user must have some attributes created.
